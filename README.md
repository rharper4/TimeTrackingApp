# TimeTrackingApp
This is a repository for my personal time tracking application project. As somebody who struggles with ADHD, I'd love to have a simple yet efficient UI that I may use to effectively track my time during end of day reflections. This application will also be my first time experimenting with github and maven builds within backend programming.
